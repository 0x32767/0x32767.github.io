            I haven't started the NEA yet, but I am thinking about features/constraints of the project, first, the programming
            language that I will compile is going to be ocr's ERL (exam reference language for GCSEs) or AQA's pseudo code
            (used for A-Level), and it will most likely compile to AQA's assembly dialect.
