            Hiya I'm Reisensei, a CS student. I am a generalist who has has made all sorts of projects, such as a discord bot with a
            database and a programming language. I have high levels of proficiency in python object oriented programming, I do
            consider myself knowledgeable in low level systems, web development, performance improvements, algorithms and data
            structures but don't consider myself overly skilled yet. I am currently a full time student studying A-Level Mathematics,
            Further Mathematics, Computer Science and German.

        <h1 class="section-heading">Programming Projects</h1>
        <div class="text-section">
          Currently, I only have two main projects I am happy with:
          <ul>
            <li>Programming Language</li>
            <li>Discord Bot</li>
          </ul>
          I hop to adding more large scale projects to this list which I believe are of high standard. Future projects I hope to
          work on are:
          <ul>
            <li>Physics engine</li>
            <li>JAR file decompiler (a bit like Ghidrah)</li>
            <li>Animation program</li>
            <li>Text compression</li>
            <li>Leetcode Clone</li>
            <li>Pickle File Inspector</li>
            <li>Search Engine</li>

        <h2>Maths</h2>
        <div class="text-section">
          I also enjoy maths and look forward to studying it at high school level (more exactly A Level). The course I am
          taking are:
          <ul>
            <li>Core Pure 1</li>
            <li>Core Pure 2</li>
            <li>Statistics and Mechanics 1</li>
            <li>Statistics and Mechanics 2</li>
            <li>Further Mechanics 1 (Optional Module)</li>
            <li>Decisions 1 (Optional Module)</li>
          </ul>
          At a brief glance I will be studying for Core Pure 1 and Core Pure 2:
          <ul>
            <li>Proofs (Induction, Exhaustion, Deduction)</li>
            <li>Complex Numbers</li>
            <li>Matrices</li>
            <li>Calculus</li>
            <li>Vectors</li>
            <li>Polar Coordinates</li>
            <li>Hyperbolic Functions</li>
            <li>Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Coordinate Geometry</li>
            <li>Sequences and Series (summations)</li>
            <li>Trigonometry (including identities)</li>
          </ul>
          What I am studying for Decisions 1:
          <ul>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Graph Theory</li>
            <li>Critical path analysis</li>
            <li>Linear Programming</li>
          </ul>
          (For more details on the above, the Edexcel A-Level Maths and Further Maths specification is available online.)
          I have also made a large quantity of notes regarding what I have been and will be taught. As these notes are at an
          A-Level further maths standard, they are not as rigorous as higher level notes and resources.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <div class="text-section">
        I play two instruments: Bag Pipes (SQA 4) and Bass Guitar (No grade). I have played in a: pipes and drums band, and a
        competition band. During my time in the pipes and drums band, I have had the opportunity to visit and play at many cool
        places. Some are listed below:
        <ul>
          <li>Menin Gate (An annual event where we play in Belgium)</li>
          <li>American Battle Monuments Commission Centenary</li>

        Hello world! I'm still working on the website, shouldn't take much longer. I've got some homework to do so I won't
        have too much time left over.
        <br>
        Update: Finally got the website to a good spot, and got all the homework done too.

        I really want to give APL a go, I have heard a ton of good stuff about it. I would give haskell a go but it feels
        less kind somehow. APL is functional and feels closer to maths than programming. I get the feeling that starting more
        or less from scratch will get me thinking in an APL way, instead of trying to find the best python equivalent in
        another language.

        More trying to learn APL. Doing my best but it's hurting my head (got up to the array indexing part). I've also got a
        test back and got a decent score, below 95%, I need to do more work ( ͡° ⁄ ͜⁄ ⁄ ⁄ ͡°)!

        I really need to come up with another programming project. Maybe it's time to make the text compressor.

        Update: I ended up trying to make a text-diff tool, it didn't go the best. I also tried to make the functional language
        but couldn't get past the lexer. I think I am a bit jaded with programming and should do some questions to get me back
        to normal.

        I think I need to make more better projects (I think that all the time, lol). I just need to get started on a project
        and get over the 20% mark, that's usually when I start to really work on it. I should also just make a list of projects
        I want to make (along with the goals I have in mind), and just make some.
        <br>
        As someone who also needs to do a programming project (which contributes to my overall A-Level grade), I should really
        get back into the habit of working on these projects.
