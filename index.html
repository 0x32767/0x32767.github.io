        I am a self-taught <b>CS student</b> based in the UK, who is currently enrolled in sixth form education. I use
        primarily <b>python</b> and can use:
        <ul>
            <li>Git/GitHub</li>
            <li>SQL(ite3)</li>
            <li>Ghidra</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS/JS</li>
        </ul>
        I also understand and can use the more common <b>C-Style</b> languages if need be. My current education (A-Levels) is
        as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>German</li>
            <li>Computer Science</li>
            <li>Maths</li>
            <li>Further Maths (with: Mechanics and Decisions)</li>
        </ul>
        Most information will be posted on my linked in account, including my resume. If you wish to continue, as a prefix,
        this website is more for dumping more informal information unrelated to work.

        Being self-taught has allowed me to create a solid understanding of many concepts, as I have more of a practical
        knowledge and experience compared to my peers. Through using libraries, such as Flask, discord.py and tensorflow I have
        developed a good-taste for OOP and structuring projects. I wouldn't say that any of my current projects are
        representative of my current skill (I haven't had time to work on projects due to my academic work load). However, being
        in A-Level (and taking CS), I will be working on an NEA shortly.
        <br>
        <br>
        The NEA is a non-exam assessment, and it is akin to a final year project at university, (my NEA is with the AQA exam
        board). I have decided to make a compiler explorer, that converts a language (like <b>C</b>) into some sort of assembly
        and shows what parts of the code correspond to what assembly. Have I mentioned that I will be doing this from
        <b>scratch</b>! I will be writing up the lexer, parser with no external dependencies. There is also a student in my
        class who is creating a project to illustrate how a CPU executes code. I want to work with this student on making an
        assembly language that we can use across our projects (just for the sake of it really :-) .

        I am also a member of my school's intermediate jazz band, and play bass guitar. As I'm a fairly new member I haven't
        played at many large events yet.

        I grew up with mainly japanese media in one form or another. Either with Kika series that where animated in Japan, or
        Ghibli shows. In summer 2024, I decided to watch certain shows that had peeked my interest, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Bocchi the Rock</li>
            <li>Grave of the Fireflies</li>
            <li>Howl's Moving Castle</li>
        </ul>
        More recently, I decided to move into some higher profile series/franchises, including shows that are just referenced
        a lot.
        <ul>
            <li>Madoka Magica</li>
            <li>Neon Genesis Evangelion</li>
            <li>86</li>
            <li>Chuunibyou</li>
            <li>Fate</li>
            <li>High School DxD</li>
            <li>Lucky Star</li>
            <li>Perfect Blue</li>
            <li>Re:Zero</li>
        </ul>

        I am generally enjoying watching anime, there are things that do get in the way of watching or interrupt the viewing
        experience aka most tropes. But I do find that some, when done right, can be entertaining or fun to watch.
        <br>
        I've also noticed that there is a lot of references to Germany in general in what I've watched.<br>
        (Rem, depicted on right, is 23rd Most "Favorited" Character on MAL, and for good reason)<br>
