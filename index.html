        <h2>Studying</h2>
        I am currently doing my A-Levels (pre-university exams).
        <ul>
          <li>German (AQA, 7662)</li>

          <li>Further Maths (Edexcel, 9FM0)</li>
        </ul>
        The further maths course allows students to choose two additional areas in which they would like to study. I am studying:
        <ul>
          <li>Further Mechanics 1 (physics based)</li>

          <summary>Maths (More detail)</summary>
          I will be learning about:
          <ul>
            <li>Proofs (Induction, Exhaustion, Deduction)</li>
            <li>Complex Numbers</li>

          It's more common for A-Level students to choose three A-Levels and do either: a graded project such as an EPQ
          (Extended Project Qualification) or take a half course (half an A-Level, referred to with <b>AS-[subject-name-here]</b>).
          However, I preferred to take on the extra work to gain a much deeper insight into the fields I find both interesting
          and fascinating.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        I always have high standards for my projects, most of them where halted due to messy code or a lack of interest in the
        project. I have only listed my more notable projects here.
        <ul>
          <li>

              <summary><a href="https://github.com/0x32767/0x102-discord-bot/tree/master">Discord Bot</a></summary>
              This bot is one of the first project I have worked on. Through this project I learned how to use the
              <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a> and
              <a href="https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/">nextcord</a> library (<b>discord.py</b> was discontinued for 6
              months in protest to very big <b>API</b> changes, and the sudden addition of slash commands). I also introduced
              myself to github and project structures.
              <br>
              This project has since been abandoned (3 years ago), and I would class it as <em>messy</em> for my current
              standard.

              <summary><a href="https://github.com/0x32767/Raicord/tree/master">Custom Discord Client</a></summary>
              I was hoping to create my own 3rd party discord client, this client would include <em>UI</em> features that
              discord, is unlikely to add. The project never progressed much, mainly because of how hard it is to coordinate
              multithreaded processes with a <em>GUI</em>.

              <summary><a href="https://github.com/0x32767/hanual">Programming Language</a></summary>
              It is a dream of all programmers to one day create their own programming language. I managed to accomplish that
              dream with <b>Hanual</b>, built from the ground up with limited third parties. Originally, the hope was to create
              programming language that had full interop with the python virtual machine. The <em>lexer</em> and <em>parser</em>
              where custom made, but it's hard to find good documentation on python's bytecode, as it isn't a standard. This
              forced me to use a third party library <a href="">bytecode</a> to handel this for me.
              <br>
              This project was reasonably successful, the language became mature enough to create a hello world, loops if
              statements and use all python builtin functions. The project has been left unmaintained as the class structure
              became messy (due to tokens being treated, internally as abstract syntax tree nodes, and meta classes being used
              to check methods for unsupported parameters). However, I am partially satisfied with the outcome of this
              project (the sudden halt in development was due to exams).

        I am currently working on a java class file decompiler, it will be available on github once it has a better structure.
        As part of my course, I will be making a project (for 3 to 4 months), this too will be available on github.

        <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
        I have been programming since I was <b>14</b> years old, and have since loved this universe of applied maths and logic.
        Over this period of time I have accumulated a lot of skill and explored several areas of <b>Computer Science</b> in
        general. While the programming is primarily self taught, I have become more mature and competent in the field by
        as a whole through the courses I take.
        <br>
        I have used the following standard libraries in my code bases:
        <table>
          <tr><th>Library</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
          <tr><td>ast</td><td>Used for python to js converter</td></tr>
          <tr><td>abc</td><td>Used to make abstract base classes; used in all my code bases</td></tr>
          <tr><td>base64</td><td>Use this to store long hashes, or bytes in a more manageable way</td></tr>
          <tr><td>dataclasses</td><td>Not Used a lot, I write my own wrapper classes</td></tr>
          <tr><td>enum</td><td>I need to use it more</td></tr>
          <tr><td>glob</td><td>Used to traverse file systems, really good and useful</td></tr>
          <tr><td>hashlib</td><td>Very good for storing an <b>id</b> of data when it is too expensive to store the file it's self</td></tr>
          <tr><td>io</td><td>Very good for large string buffers and reading strings like files</td></tr>
          <tr><td>json</td><td>Used to parse JSON, mainly for APIs</td></tr>
          <tr><td>pickle</td><td>perfect for storing large python objects, less good because of <b>__reduce__</b> insecure deserialization</td></tr>
          <tr><td>pprint</td><td>good for printing large amounts of data, (better to use <b>json.dumps</b> for dictionaries and lists)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>re</td><td>Used for lexical analysis and string identification, usually write my own lexers for convenience</td></tr>
          <tr><td>random</td><td>great for making random numbers</td></tr>
          <tr><td>socket</td><td>requirement for any sort of networking</td></tr>
          <tr><td>sqlite3</td><td>Used for toy databases locally; used in my discord bot</td></tr>
          <tr><td>string</td><td>saves out typing the alphabet in code</td></tr>
          <tr><td>tkinter</td><td>Have used for quick GUIs, prefer to use <b>pygame</b> or <b>dearpyimgui</b></td></tr>
          <tr><td>typing</td><td>great for auto-correct, not good because you need to learn types</td></tr>
          <tr><td>urllib</td><td>Parsing URLs, very useful for my website archiver</td></tr>
          <tr><td>uuid</td><td>I prefer to hash the object that the uuid is for</td></tr>
        </table>
        Other libraries include:
        <table>
          <tr><th>Library</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
          <tr><td>tensorflow</td><td>Making some simple AI models, mainly trying to make an LLM</td></tr>
          <tr><td>transformers</td><td>Fine tuning my own model, <b>c.ai</b> but free</td></tr>
          <tr><td>discord.py</td><td>Making discord bots</td></tr>
          <tr><td>httpx</td><td><b>requests</b> alternative, with more features</td></tr>
          <tr><td>flask</td><td>making very simple web apps</td></tr>
          <tr><td>pygame</td><td>making simple animations and games</td></tr>
          <tr><td>dearpyimgui</td><td>making quick and dirty GUIs</td></tr>
          <tr><td>beautifulsoup4</td><td>prefer to use builtin <b>http</b> module</td></tr>
