<h2 class="project_info_hdr">0x102 Discord Bot</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  0x102 is a project I started in April 2022. This was the first main project I
  worked on for a long time. The project was the first one that uses OOP and a
  fairly mainstream library. The project also included many other features that
  had to be trimmed due to discord's (at the time) new limitations to discord
  bots.
</p>
<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>
  I have since moved on from creating discord bots and am working on more
  ambitios projects. However, the code base is still fairly usable, with the
  only concerns being backwards compatability with the deprecated (version 6)
  discord API. Never the less the codebase is still fairly well documented with
  good code quality and comments. The bot is also under the MIT licence, and I
  am still happy for anyone to fork the code or make it their own.
</p>
<h2>What I learned with the project</h2>
<p>
  The bot was my main introduction to programming, it taught me manny good
  practices such as the "enumerate" function. Discord.py also makes heavy use of
  OOP and asyncrenous code, and while the code doesn't use asyncrenous
  programming to it's full potentiall, I did learn about the core concepts of
  async programming.
