<h2 class="project_info_hdr">EoSDecomp</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  EoSDecomp is a decompilation effort that aims to create a byte accurate
  decompilation of TouHou 6 ~ The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The game was
  originally made with DirectX8 which was become more and more unstable with
  newer windows updates, causing unexpected crashes and unplayability. Once the
  source code has been extracted, the plan is to migrate the game to a newer
  version of Direct X.

<h2>Current state</h2>

  The project is available on
  <a href="https://github.com/wearrrrr/EoSDecomp">github</a> and has a discord
  server.

<h2>What I learned with the project</h2>
<p>
  My current goal is to reimplement the directx functions. This will give the
  team a better idea of what data types are being used where. My main take aways
  are understanding a bit of asembely code, understanding ghidra and more about
  data sctuctures. I am also learning more about C and the microsoft VSC tool
  chain.
