<h2 class="project_info_hdr">Hanual</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Hanual is a programming language written in python 311. The language was
  written mostly from scratch with the only dependancy being
  <a href="https://github.com/tartley/colorama">colorama</a> used to print
  colored text. Everything else including an LR parser was written from scratch.
  The language is highly extendable with "hooks" wich allow python code to be
  injected into the compiler to change the way code can be compiled. This allows
  users to add new syntax to the language as they please.
</p>
<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>
  I have manny plans to finish hanual, being to implement a package manager and
  actually add the compiler with LLVM. The lexing, parsing and hooks are all
  finished and have an intuitive and robust API. The language is also still to
  be fully documented, mostly because the language whent through a massive
  syntax redesign. However, I still have high ambitions for it to show its' self
  as an effecient, fast and reliable language.

<h2>What I learned with the project</h2>
<p>
  I have learned manny skills from the project, most relating to good OOP
  structures, sticking to good practices and maintaining a large project. I am
  also hopping to learn good documentation practices.
