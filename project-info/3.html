<h2 class="project_info_hdr">Y</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Y is a twitter joke, all jokes asside, it is a P2P (pier 2 pier) E2EE (end 2
  end encrypted) messenger app written in hanual, my custom programming
  language.

<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>
  I have not fully started this project. It will require me to finish hanual
  first to a satisfactorry degree. I am however, going to do a lot of digging
  into cryptography to make this as secure as possible.
